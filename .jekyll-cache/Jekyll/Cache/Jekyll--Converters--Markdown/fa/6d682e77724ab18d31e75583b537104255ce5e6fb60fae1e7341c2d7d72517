I"?<p>You can use the Decentraland CLI to query info directly from LAND tokens in the blockchain and from the scene files uploaded to the content server.</p>

<p>To run these commands, you must first <a href="/development-guide/installation-guide/">Install the CLI</a>.</p>

<h2 id="get-info-about-a-scene">Get info about a scene</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl info</code> command returns the contents of a scene’s <em>scene.json</em> file, including owner, contact info, and parcels in the scene.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl info</code> from the scene’s folder returns info about that specific scene.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl info x,y</code>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are parcel coordinates, returns info about the scene in that location.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: Don’t add a space between both coordinates.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl info id</code>, where <em>id</em> is an estate id, returns info about the scene with that estate id.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl status</code> command returns a list with the files deployed to a scene. This only includes file names and sizes. You can’t access the contents of the files via the CLI.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl status</code> from the scene’s folder returns info about that specific scene.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl status x,y</code>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are parcel coordinates (with no spaces between them), returns info about the scene in that location.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: Don’t add a space between both coordinates.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl status id</code>, where <em>id</em> is an estate id, returns info about the scene with that estate id.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Everything that’s uploaded to our content server is public and reachable through that network. When you deploy a scene, by default you’re not uploading the original source code for the scene, instead you upload a version that’s compiled to minified JavaScript, which is a lot less readable.</p>

<h2 id="get-info-from-a-wallet-address">Get info from a wallet address</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl info</code> command also lets you see info about an Ethereum wallet and the LAND tokens that it owns.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcl info xxxx</code>, where <em>xxxx</em> is the Ethereum address you’re interested in, returns a list of all the LAND parcels and estates owned by that address and their details.</li>
</ul>
