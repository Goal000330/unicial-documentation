<h2 id="your-wallet">Your Wallet</h2>

<p>Before using <a href="https://market.decentraland.org">market.decentraland.org</a>, connect and log into an Ethereum client account that can interact with the web browser. We recommend using <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>. We also support the use of a <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/">Ledger</a> hardware wallet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet in the Marketplace, it will require you to connect it towards MetaMask. Please ensure you follow all the <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020394612-How-to-connect-a-Trezor-or-Ledger-Hardware-Wallet">given steps</a> and updates to allow a seamless Ledger usage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When navigating the Marketplace, your wallet address is treated as your account, you don’t need any additional log in.</p>

<p>The Marketplace currently hosts LAND and names solely on Ethereums network. Wearables differ between Ethereum and Polygons network. Ethereum based transactions require a GAS fee, paid in Ethereum. Wheras Polygon based transactions only require a small amount of MATIC, to perform actions in the Marketplace.</p>
