I"%<p>Wearables are the various items of clothing, accessories, and body features that can be used to customize the appearance of a Decentraland avatar. There is a selection of default wearables that are freely available to all avatars, but Decentraland also supports the creation and use of custom wearables that are represented by non-fungible tokens (or NFTs). This allows a finite amount of different wearables to be created, or minted, on the blockchain, similar to the LAND.</p>

<p>By default, Decentraland Wearables are minted on the Polygon/Matic sidechain so users can mint, buy, sell, or transfer items without having to pay gas fees.</p>

<p><strong>Wearables are organized into different categories, depending on what part of an avatar they modify:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Body shape (the shape of the entire avatar)</li>
  <li>Hat</li>
  <li>Helmet</li>
  <li>Hair</li>
  <li>Facial hair</li>
  <li>Head</li>
  <li>Upper body (e.g. jacket or shirt)</li>
  <li>Lower body (e.g. pants or shorts)</li>
  <li>Feet</li>
  <li>Skin</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Wearables can also include accessories that are applied to different parts of an avatar‚Äôs body:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mask</li>
  <li>Eye wear</li>
  <li>Earring</li>
  <li>Tiara (a crown, or other accessory that sits on top of the head)</li>
  <li>Top-head (e.g. a halo, or other effect applied to the head)</li>
</ul>

<p>For a detailed description of each category, and how items within each category interact or replace one another, see <a href="/decentraland/creating-wearables/">Creating Wearables</a>.</p>

<h3 id="collections--items">Collections &amp; Items</h3>

<p>Wearables exist as individual <strong>items</strong> that can be grouped into <strong>collections</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="items">Items</h4>

<p>Remember how wearables are represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs)? Well, each wearable <strong>item</strong> can be minted to create multiple NFTs of that same item, to a limit according to the item‚Äôs rarity (the rarer the item, the fewer NFTs you can mint). Items are often referred to as the ‚Äúrepresentations‚Äù of the wearable.</p>

<p>Items cannot be bought or sold, only the NFTs that have been minted from items. Also, individual items cannot be published on their own; they must be part of a collection.</p>

<h4 id="collections">Collections</h4>

<p><strong>Collections</strong> exist to help creators organize and manage their items before publication.</p>

<p>For example, let‚Äôs say we create a blue t-shirt and a red t-shirt. We can create a new collection called ‚ÄúSummer T-Shirts‚Äù, and then add our two shirts to that collection. After publishing our collection, we can then mint copies of the red and blue shirts to share, trade, or sell.</p>
