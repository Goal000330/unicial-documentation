I"­<p><strong>Decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Within the Decentraland platform, users can create, experience, and monetize their content and applications.</strong></p>

<p>The finite, traversable, 3D virtual space within Decentraland is called <strong>LAND</strong>, a non-fungible digital asset maintained in an Ethereum smart contract. Land is divided into <strong>parcels</strong> that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased using MANA, Decentralandâ€™s cryptocurrency token. This gives users full control over the environments and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games.</p>

<p>Some parcels are further organized into themed communities, or <a href="https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/glossary/#district">Districts</a>. By organizing parcels into Districts, the community can create shared spaces with common interests and uses. You can find a list of the original District Proposals on <a href="https://github.com/decentraland/districts">GitHub</a>. The content that makes up Decentraland is stored and distributed via a decentralized network while ownership and transactions are validated on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
