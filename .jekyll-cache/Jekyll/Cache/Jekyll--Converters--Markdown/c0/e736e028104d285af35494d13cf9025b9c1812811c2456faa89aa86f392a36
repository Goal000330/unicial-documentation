I"\<p>One of the most common questions received about the DAO is <em>“how much MANA does the DAO have, and what is it for?”</em></p>

<p>The DAO possesses <strong>222 million</strong> MANA by means of a 10 year vesting contract.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing (May 21 2021), of that 222 million MANA, roughly <strong>14.1 million</strong> MANA has been released (withdrawn) from the vesting contract. In addition to that 14.1 million MANA, an additional <strong>13.5 million</strong> MANA may be released as of the time of this writing. This makes for a total of <strong>27.6</strong> million MANA currently available to the DAO.</p>

<p>The MANA in this contract vests every second, thus gradually increasing the size of the DAO’s fund.</p>

<p>You can view the DAO’s vesting contract <a href="https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac">here</a>.</p>

<p>The DAO also has several sources of income:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The 2.5% transaction fees within the Decentraland Marketplaces on primary market commissions go to the DAO</li>
  <li>The OpenSea Marketplace also receives a 2.5% transaction fee for sales of LAND, Estates, Names, and wearables, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942?a=0x9b814233894cd227f561b78cc65891aa55c62ad2">part of which is transferred to the DAO</a>.</li>
</ul>
