<p>While editing a scene, press the <em>Download scene</em> icon to download the contents of the scene as a <em>.zip</em> file. In the scene selector screen, you can also press the <em>three dots</em> icon and select <em>Download scene</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/media/builder-export.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can then share this scene with another Builder user, or edit the scene with more freedom by using the Decentraland SDK.</p>

<p>See <a href="/development-guide/SDK-101/">SDK 101</a> if you’re not yet familiar with coding with the Decentraland SDK.</p>

<h2 id="import-a-scene">Import a scene</h2>

<p>In the scene selector screen, press <em>Import scene</em>, then drag one or several <em>.zip</em> files from exported Builder scenes and press <em>Import</em>.</p>

<p>If a scene is too large to import, try this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decompress the scene <em>.zip</em> file.</li>
  <li>Look for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">builder.json</code> inside the uncompressed folder. Compress that single file into a new <em>.zip</em> file.</li>
  <li>Import this new <em>.zip</em> file.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can only import scenes that have been built with the Builder. You can’t import a scene that was built with the SDK or modified with it.</p>

<h2 id="delete-a-scene">Delete a scene</h2>

<p>In the scene selector screen, press the <em>three dots</em> icon and select <em>Delete scene</em>.</p>

<h2 id="scene-storage">Scene storage</h2>

<p>If your Builder account is accessed via an in-browser wallet, like Metamask or Dapper, all of your existing scenes are saved and updated to a cloud storage that you can access from any other device where you’re logged in.</p>

<p>If you don’t have your account connected to an in-browser wallet, your scenes are stored in the browser’s cache storage. They won’t be available if you log in from another device. Be careful not to clear the browser’s storage, as you will lose your scenes. We advise exporting your scenes to keep a backup in your local disk.</p>
