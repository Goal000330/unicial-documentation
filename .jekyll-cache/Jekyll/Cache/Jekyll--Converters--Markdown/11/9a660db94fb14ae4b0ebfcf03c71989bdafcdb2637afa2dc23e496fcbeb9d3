I"2<p>You can create your own decentralized apps (dApps) to interface with Decentraland’s smart contracts and expose their functionality in more elaborate and friendlier ways.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-dapp">What is a dApp</h2>

<p>A decentralized application, or dApp, is one that runs on a distributed peer to peer network rather than from a central server.</p>

<p>In the context of blockchain, a dApp uses smart contracts and possibly a P2P network, instead of a Web API service. A dApp may also expose a front end and cache information from the blockchain temporarily, but its output is ultimately reflected on-chain.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://blockchainhub.net/decentralized-applications-dapps/">this site</a> for a more complete overview about dApps.</p>

<h2 id="decentraland-smart-contracts">Decentraland smart contracts</h2>

<p>Decentraland has written and maintains a number of smart contracts that interact with LAND and MANA tokens.</p>

<p>LAND and MANA tokens themselves are defined by the <em>LANDregistry</em> and <em>MANAtoken</em> contracts respectively. The list also includes more specific contracts like creating an estate out of several parcels or mortgaging parcels.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://contracts.decentraland.org/addresses.json">Decentraland smart contracts</a>:
You can find a full list of each of our contracts and their addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that each contract has a production version in <em>mainnet</em> and a test version in <em>ropsten</em> and that each has a different address.</p>

<p>You can read the full code of each contract, as it’s public information on the blockchain. For example, you can find the contract by name on <a href="https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified">Etherscan</a> to read its contents.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/dapp-boilerplate">Boilerplate code</a>: This Boilerplate code can be a great starting point for building your own dApp.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="helper-libraries">Helper libraries</h2>

<p>While building our own dApps internally, we put together some helper libraries that you might also find useful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-eth">Decentraland-eth</a>: This is a low level library with utility functions to work with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-dapps">Decentraland-dapps</a>: This is a higher level library with common modules for dApps. The modules in this library are built using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Decentraland-eth</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ui.decentraland.org/">Decentraland UI</a>: This library contains a selection of reusable UI elements that are included in Decentraland’s projects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sample-dapps">Sample dApps</h2>

<p>Below are links to the full code of several dApps that we built around Decentraland, these might help you build your own:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/canilla">Canilla</a>: This basic dApp provides free Ropsten MANA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/gate">Gate</a>: This basic dApp creates an invitation NFT that was used when Decentraland was in a closed beta stage. In the early days, whitelisted players that held this NFT were the only ones able to enter the metaverse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace">Marketplace</a>: This is the full application that runs the Decentraland <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/">Marketplace</a>. To make it run fast, it requires a database and a backend server connected to the Ethereum network to create indexes with information about LAND.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dapp-testing-framework">dApp testing framework</h2>

<p>Before launching your dApp into production, we recommend testing it first.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/decentraland/dappeteer">dAppeteer</a>: We put this framework together to help you run tests on your dApp.</li>
</ul>
