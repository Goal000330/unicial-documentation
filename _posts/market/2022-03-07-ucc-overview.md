UCC is an ERC-20 fungible token built on the Zilionixx blockchain. It is the main utility token and the currency of The Unicial's ecosystem. It is also a governance token.
As such, UCC will be required for the buying and selling of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as SPACE, ASSETs, from Unicial's marketplace.
